# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Alphabet Soup is a foundation dedicted to helping organizations that protect the environment, protect people's wellbeing and unify the world.  The foundation needs a tool to determine which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk so they know their funds are being used effectively.  The purpose of this analysis is to develop a neural network to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The dataset used for this analysis includes data from more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup.  The following steps will be completed to build the neural network:

* Preprocess the data
* Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
* Optimize the Model
    
## Results
    
### Data Preprocessing

* The target variable for this model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" category.  

* The variables considered to be features of the the model include all of the columns except "IS_SUCCESSFUL" as the target variable and "EIN" and "NAME" as they were       dropped.  These other variables include application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization, status, income amount and ask amount.        

* Variables that were neither targets or features for the dataset were "EIN" and "NAME" as these 2 variables will have minimal impact of the outcome.

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
