# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Alphabet Soup is a foundation dedicted to helping organizations that protect the environment, protect people's wellbeing and unify the world.  The foundation needs a tool to determine which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk so they know their funds are being used effectively.  The purpose of this analysis is to develop a neural network to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The dataset used for this analysis includes data from more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup.  The following steps will be completed to build the neural network:

    *Preprocess the data
    *Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
    *Optimize the Model
